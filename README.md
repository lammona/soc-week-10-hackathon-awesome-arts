## Challenges & Learnings

- This week, we witnessed the power of AI in app development‚Äîit completely blew us away.

Given our plan to build a simple site showcasing DevOps, V0 seemed like the perfect tool. But, much like Dr. Frankenstein, we ended up creating a monster.

- In V0, everything worked fine, but once we moved it to VSCode, things fell apart. Our lack of familiarity with Next.js made debugging a real challenge. We went down a rabbit hole trying to fix the issues and struggled to find our way out. This experience reinforced the need to deeply understand the frameworks we use, rather than relying solely on AI-generated code.

## Future Improvements

- With more time, we would develop a mobile app version.
- We also envisioned expanding the app‚Äôs functionality to serve as a family calendar and a gift list repository, making it even more useful for parents and caregivers.
